I developed a simple Sudoku game in C++ using an object-oriented approach. The core of the project is the "Sudoku_Game" class, which encapsulates methods for loading puzzles, printing them, handling user input, verifying correctness, and solving the grid. Additionally, the function "gameplay" runs a typical game from beginning to end. I also created a Puzzle_Collection class that stores multiple puzzles and can return one at random, allowing the game to provide variety without manually generating puzzles. This design highlights modularity and reusability â€” each class has a clear responsibility and interacts cleanly with the other.

During implementation, I made use of OOP concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction, as well as function overloading to handle different input formats. Recursion was applied in the solving algorithm through backtracking, which required careful handling of base cases to avoid infinite loops. Double pointers were used to dynamically manage the two-dimensional arrays representing the puzzle grid, though this also introduced complexity in memory management and debugging.

Troubleshooting primarily involved ensuring valid puzzle states and correctly backtracking when no valid move existed. Logic bugs often appeared when validating rows, columns, or sub-grids, requiring step-by-step tracing. Overall, the project emphasized both algorithmic problem solving and structured C++ design principles.

This game however is not complete, with validation and restrictions in some areas missing (such as preventing the user from changing a pre-defined value, etc)
