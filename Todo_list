This is a list of features I plan to implement in this code. 
The primary purpose is to explore and practice implementing different functionality and features.

1. Write test cases for the different functionality in the classes using GoogleTest.
2. Implement true randomness for the puzzle collection and use a memory feature to ensure that no puzzle
   is repeated in a single game session 
   (Keep a array or dynamic pointer that stores the previous puzzles (index value) and so ensures no repetition).
3. Use pdcursor for better and more intuitive user interface. It also allows me to ensure portability of the code.
4. Implement functionality that would allow the user to verify the validity of a move after he makes it.
   (Possible way to implement this: Solve the puzzle in the backend after it's loaded and keep
   that stored. Then if user requests a check, compare it with that).
5. Prevent the user from changing the pre-defined value cells in the puzzles 
   (Possible ways to implement this: Making a copy of the original and verifying during
   input that the cell index corresponds to a zero-value cell of the original).
6. Create a Game class to encapsulate the gameplay functionality (including recording time for the game) and 
   a Session class for the overall session maintenance (can keep track of time per game and such records)
